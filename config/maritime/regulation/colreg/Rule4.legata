# COLREG.Rule4:

define: {
    OS: OwnShip
}



condition: {
    # Trigger rule 4 if the vessel is in zero visibility.
    : OS.Visibility <= 0  
}

# In other words, if there is zero visibility and the vessel does not have the instruments 
# to proceed safely, the speed of the water craft should be reduced and course corrections 
# made, until adequate vision is restored for safe operation of the vessel.
