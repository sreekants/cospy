# Overtaking
# (a) Notwithstanding anything contained in the Rules of Part B, Sections I and II any vessel overtaking
# any other shall keep out of the way of the vessel being overtaken.
# (b) A vessel shall be deemed to be overtaking when coming up with another vessel from a direction
# more than 22.5 degrees abaft her beam, that is, in such a position with reference to the vessel she is
# overtaking, that at night she would be able to see only the sternlight of that vessel but neither of her
# sidelights.
# (c) When a vessel is in any doubt as to whether she is overtaking another, she shall assume that this
# is the case and act accordingly.
# (d) Any subsequent alteration of the bearing between the two vessels shall not make the overtaking
# vessel a crossing vessel within the meaning of these Rules or relieve her of the duty of keeping clear
# of the overtaken vessel until she is finally past and clear.
