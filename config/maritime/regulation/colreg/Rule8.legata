# (ii) A vessel required not to impede the passage or safe passage of another vessel is not
# relieved of this obligation if approaching the other vessel so as to involve risk of collision
# and shall, when taking action, have full regard to the action which may be required by
# the Rules of this part.

# the rules of this part when the two vessels are approaching one another so as to involve
# risk of collision.
