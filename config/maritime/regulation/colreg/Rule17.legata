# Action by Stand-on Vessel
# (a)
# (i) Where one of two vessels is to keep out of the way the other shall keep her course and
# speed.
# (ii) The latter vessel may however take action to avoid collision by her manoeuvre alone, as
# soon as it becomes apparent to her that the vessel required to keep out of the way is
# not taking appropriate action in compliance with these Rules.
# (b) When, from any cause, the vessel required to keep her course and speed finds herself so close
# that collision cannot be avoided by the action of the give-way vessel alone, she shall take such action
# as will best aid to avoid collision.
# (c) A power-driven vessel which takes action in a crossing situation in accordance with sub-paragraph
# (a)(ii) of this Rule to avoid collision with another power-driven vessel shall, if the circumstances of
# the case admit, not alter course to port for a vessel on her own port side.
# (d) This Rule does not relieve the give-way vessel of her obligation to keep out of the way
