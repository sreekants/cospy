# Definitions
# (a) 'Masthead light' means a white light placed over the fore and aft centerline of the
# vessel showing an unbroken light over an arc of the horizon of 225 degrees and so
# fixed as to show the light from right ahead to 22.5 degrees abaft the beam on either
# side of the vessel.
# (b) 'Sidelights' means a green light on the starboard side and a red light on the port
# side each showing an unbroken light over an arc of the horizon of 112.5 degrees and
# so fixed as to show the light from right ahead to 22.5 degrees abaft the beam on its
# respective side. In a vessel of less than 20 meters in length the sidelights may be
# combined in one lantern carried on the fore and aft centreline of the vessel.
# (c) 'Sternlight' means a white light placed as nearly as practicable at the stern
# showing an unbroken light over an arc of the horizon of 135 degrees and so fixed as
# to show the light 67.5 degrees from right aft on each side of the vessel.
# (d) 'Towing light' means a yellow light having the same characteristics as the
# 'sternlight' defined in paragraph(c) of this COLREG.

# of 360 degrees.
