<h1>Layers in the Framework</h1>
<p>
  The entire framework is broken down into 4 layers and several modules
  in each layer. The reason for this is to logically separate the vast 
  number of classes into layers and further break down the facilities
  in a layer into small manageable modules which then consist of classes.
  By organizing the framework this way, you as a user can select what the
  modules you need for your application and link into only those necessary
  modules. 
</p>

<p>
  The following list describes the layers in the framework and their function. 
<ul>
  <li><b style="font-weight:bold"><a href="Layer.cos.xml">cos</a></b>: The core layer implements the kernel of the operating system 
    and the simulation enviroment.
  </li>
  <li><b style="font-weight:bold"><a href="Layer.cai.xml">cai</a></b>: This layer provides general purpose reusable libraries for building AI-assisted solutions. 
    They are not mandatory for runnign the system but is avilable for reuse in higher level modules.
  </li>
  <li><b style="font-weight:bold"><a href="Layer.maritime.xml">maritime</a></b>: The maritime layer provides complete set of classes to implement maritime simulations.
  </li>
  <li><b style="font-weight:bold"><a href="Layer.rules.xml">rules</a></b>: The rules layer implements validation and testing utilities for regulations including - COLREGs and MASS.
  </li>
</ul>
