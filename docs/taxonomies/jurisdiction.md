Jurisdictional categories in the maritime industry, particularly in relation to COLREGs, play a crucial role in determining the applicability of different rules and regulations. These categories are defined by the extent of territorial waters and international agreements. Here are six terms describing jurisdictional categories in the maritime industry:

1. **Territorial Waters**: This jurisdiction extends up to 12 nautical miles from a country's baseline (usually the low-water line along the coast). Within this zone, the coastal state exercises full sovereignty, and all national laws, including those related to navigation and safety like COLREGs, apply.

2. **Contiguous Zone**: Extending up to 24 nautical miles from a country's baseline, this zone allows a state to enforce laws related to customs, immigration, and sanitation. While it is not a full sovereignty zone, the state has the right to take preventative measures.

3. **Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ)**: This area stretches up to 200 nautical miles from the baseline. Within the EEZ, a coastal state has exclusive rights to exploit natural resources, both living and non-living. Navigation, however, remains free under international law, and general COLREGs apply to all vessels transiting through this zone.

4. **High Seas**: Beyond the EEZ, the high seas are open to all states, whether coastal or land-locked. Navigation here is governed by international law, particularly the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), and COLREGs are universally applied to prevent collisions.

5. **International Straits**: These are narrow passages of water used for international navigation between two areas of the high seas or between the high seas and other waters. Even though they may pass through a country's territorial waters, transit passage is permitted under international law, and specific rules from COLREGs apply to ensure safe passage.

6. **Archipelagic Waters**: For archipelagic states (like Indonesia or the Philippines), these are waters enclosed by the archipelagic baselines drawn between the outermost points of the archipelagoâ€™s islands. Special rules apply here to balance the rights of the archipelagic state with those of the international community, ensuring both resource control and freedom of navigation under COLREGs.

Understanding these jurisdictional categories helps in navigating the complex legal frameworks governing maritime activities, ensuring compliance with both national and international regulations, including safety standards under COLREGs.
